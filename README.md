Code the flexible Python IRC Bot
================================

Build State: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Liamraystanley/Code.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Liamraystanley/Code)

Code (on #L @ irc.esper.net) is a open source python IRC bot forked from Phenny/Jenni, with new modules, easier to understand commands, and easy installation! Code can run on any operating system that supports Python 2.7 or higher.

Features
-------- 
________

Code is packed full of features ranging from raw IRC functions to modules that can be unloaded and loaded with ease. Some features include:

Fast & Light Weight
- Code is very small, so it won't take up resources. Also, Code is very responsive and quick-paced! Also he can run in 1-2 processes!

Load & Unload Modules
- Code has the ability to load user defined IRC modules, that are pre-made or ones that you create. Code also can live-reload modules for active and fast development.

Very User Friendly
- It is very easy to install and run Code, even if you have no knowledge of ever running a IRC bot before. ".help" commands, and friendly responses help everything feel smooth and elegant.

Easy-To-use API
- When creating your own modules, it is always very easy to have a fully documented API and easy to understand functions.

Open-Source
- Found a bug, feature, or technical support/advice? You can always navigate to the [Github](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code) page to make requests and post bugs. Heck, even fork Code as your own and make your own modifications!</dd>

Configuration
- By default, Code has the ability to change his username (including NickServ Authentication), server (including server password), and excluded channel/modules, and more.

Installation - How do I install? 
================================

**If you have any issues during the install, feel free to head to http://chat.liamstanley.io/ to get help**


Unix & Unix-like OS: 
--------------------

    1) Make sure you have Python installed `http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/`
       - (packaged in lots of *nix distros)
    2) Run `git clone https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code.git`
       - if you do not have git installed, simply install it via your package manager.
         e.i, `sudo apt-get install git`
    3) Run `./code`- this creates a default config file 
    4) Edit ~/.code/config.json 
    5) Run `./code` - this now runs code with your settings 

Full command would be: 

    python code

If you wish to run Code on a UNIX shell, the best thing to do would be to fork it to the background process using screen. You do this by execution python/Code with:

    screen -S code ./code

This creates a terminal window that can be logged into and out without disturbing the process in that window. to exit screen safely, hit `CTRL+A` then `CTRL+D`.
To log back into, and view the playback of Code, type `screen -x code`.


Windows: 
--------------------


    1) Make sure you have Python installed `http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/`
    2) Download Code here: `https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code/zipball/master` and unzip it.
    3) Configure Code's default.py file, located in your user directory.
       - This is often, `C:\\users\(your username)\.code\default.py`.
       - Note, notepad is not prefered. If anything, use Notepad++ under windows.
    3) You can open up command prompt, `cd` to Codes directory, and execute Code with `python code`.
       - Note, if command prompt says that `python` is not a internal or external command/program,
         that means Python failed to be added to your system-wide %PATH% file.
         So, you need to add it to the %PATH% variable.
         Feel free to google that one, Code is not COMPLETELY noob-friendly.


Configuration & Personalization 
===============================
_______________________________

Warning! Once you install Code using the method above, you need to configure him to point to the server you wish to connect him to, as well as add a module path, and administrators/owners.

Unix & Unix-like OS: 
--------------------

Edit the file located at `~/.code/config.json`.

Windows
-------

Edit the file located in your Documents folder, which should be located at: 
`C:\users\myusername\.code\config.json` (for Windows Vista/7/8)
`config.json` might be located in the same spot as the UNIX location listed above.
You should see configuration file.
